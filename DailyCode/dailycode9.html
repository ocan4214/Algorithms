    Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

    This problem was asked by Twitter.
    
    Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.
    
    For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
    
    Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
    <script>
        let wordArray = ["dog","deer","deal"];
        let query="de";
        let suggestionArray =[];
        for(let i=0;i<wordArray.length;i++)
        {
            if(wordArray[i].startsWith(query))
            {
                suggestionArray.push(wordArray[i])
            }
        }

        console.log("Query = " + query + "," + " Suggestion Array = " + suggestionArray);

    </script>
</body>

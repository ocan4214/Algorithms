    Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

    This problem was asked by Airbnb.

    Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or
    negative.

    For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we
    pick 5 and 5.

    Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

    <script>
        ///Dynamic programming
        let numbArray = [2, 4, 6, 2, 5,9,9,9,9]
        //sum1 n-1 th sum, sum2 is n-1-1 + new Value
        let sum=0; 
        let sum1 = numbArray[1];
        let sum2 = numbArray[0];
        let temp =0;
        function calculateSum(number)
        {   
            if(sum1>sum2+number)
            {
               temp = sum2;
               sum2 = sum1;
               sum1 = temp+number;
            }
            else
            {
                temp = sum1;
                sum1 = sum2 + number
                sum2 = temp;
            }
        }
        for(let i=2;i<numbArray.length;i++)
        {
            sum = calculateSum(numbArray[i]);
        }
        console.log(Math.max(sum1,sum2));
    </script>

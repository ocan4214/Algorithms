Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
<div>1, 1, 1, 1</div>
<div>2, 1, 1</div>
<div>1, 2, 1</div>
<div>1, 1, 2</div>
<div>2, 2</div>
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.
<script>
    //Dynamic Programming
    let uniqueCount =0;
    let destinationSteps = 4;

    function uniqueStepFinder(totalSteps)
    {
        console.log("Called in order " + totalSteps);
        if(totalSteps ==0)
        {
            console.log("Runned for " +totalSteps)
            return 1;
        }
        else if(totalSteps<0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        {
            uniqueCount = uniqueStepFinder(totalSteps-1) + uniqueStepFinder(totalSteps-2);
            return uniqueCount;
        }

    }

    uniqueStepFinder(destinationSteps);
    console.log("Unique Count = " + uniqueCount);
